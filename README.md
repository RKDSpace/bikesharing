The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. This data is prepared for one of the key stakeholders who would like to see a bike trip analysis.

To help the key stakeholder see a clear representation of the analysis, I have created a story in Tableau. The story had 7 solid visualizations as follows:
1.	Checkout times for users. This line graph shows that checkout times reach the highest peak of almost 150k bikes for 20 minutes.
2.	Checkout times by Gender. This line graph reflects that more bikes are checked by males – far outweighing the number that females check out. 
3.	Trips by Weekday per Hour. This heat map reflects the numbers were highest on Monday and Tuesday 5-6 pm and Thursday 5-6 pm
4.	Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour). This heat map reflects Males vs Females highest days being Mon, Tues, and Thursday (males still more than females)
5.	User Trips by Gender by Weekday. This heat map reflects Males outweigh more subscriptions than any other category.
6.	Subscribers’ vs customers. This pie graph reflects the number of subscriptions vs customers (a good point to show our stakeholder of the high number of scribers we can get. 
7.	Gender breakdown of males vs females and unknown. Men far outweigh the number of women. This is something I want to show the stakeholders so they are aware with a more advertisements geared toward women they can get more women subscribers in Des Moines.

The analysis done at this point is a great way to give the stakeholders a quick snapshot of how the bike sharing would work in Des Moines. It also gives an idea of more outreach should be done towards women and the times they should anticipate more bikes would be used. Two additional visualizations I added were pie graphs because I wanted to show this difference between males and females. What is causing males to use the bike sharing more than females? Is it due to more advertisements geared towards men?  If the stakeholders decide they want to do the bike sharing in Des Moines then I would bring in more data on bike repairs, geographical areas in the city that bikes are stationed, and any theft we have of the bikes.
